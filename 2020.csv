"Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Office of Energy Demand and Integrated Statistics, Forms EIA-457A, D, E, F, & G of the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey
Notes:  Because of rounding, data may not sum to totals.  See RECS Terminology for definition of terms used in these tables. 
Btu = British thermal units
a Consumption and expenditures for biomass (wood), coal, district steam, and solar thermal are excluded. Electricity consumption from on-site solar photovoltaic generation (that is, solar panels) is included.
b Total U.S. includes all primary occupied housing units in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Vacant housing units, seasonal units, second homes, military houses, and group quarters are excluded.
c Housing units are classified using criteria created by the U.S. Census Bureau based on 2010 Census data. Urbanized areas are densely settled groupings of blocks or tracts with 50,000 or more people, while urban clusters have at least 2,500 but less than 50,000 people. All other areas are rural.
d The Building America program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), created these climate regions. We combined climate regions for this publication. The Subarctic region is included with data for Very-cold/Cold.
e Rented includes households that occupy their primary housing units without paying rent.
f Total square footage includes all basements, finished or conditioned (heated or cooled) areas of attics, and conditioned garage space that is attached to the home. Unconditioned and unfinished areas in attics and attached garages are excluded. The square footage of the home is based on respondent reports. Previous RECS cycles calculated square footage based on interviewer measurements. For households that did not report an exact square footage estimate, the square footage of the home was imputed based on a reported square footage range and/or characteristics of the home. See 2020 RECS Square Footage Methodology for full details about data collection and processing.
g Some other fuel includes coal and district steam.
Q = Data withheld because either the relative standard error (RSE) was greater than 50% or fewer than 10 households in reporting sample.
N = No households in reporting sample.          ",,,,,,,,,
