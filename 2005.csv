   1  One of five climatically distinct areas, determined according to the 30-year average (1971-2000) of the annual heating and cooling degree-days.    A household is assigned to a climate zone according to the 30-year average annual degree-days for an appropriate nearby weather station.
   2  Energy consumption and expenditures in this table excludes primary electricity and wood.
   Q = Data withheld either because the Relative Standard Error (RSE) was greater than 50 percent or fewer than 10 households were sampled.
   N = No cases in the reporting sample.
   (*) Number less than 0.5, 0.05, or 0.005 depending on the number of significant digits in the column, rounded to zero.
