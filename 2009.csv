"     1Includes all primary occupied housing units in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Vacant housing units, seasonal units, second homes, military housing, and group quarters are excluded.
     2Data in these tables represent site or delivered energy. Consumption and expenditures for biomass (e.g. wood), coal, and solar are excluded. See RECS Terminology (http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/terminology.cfm) for further explanation of these terms.
     3Housing units are classified as urban or rural using definitions created by the U.S. Census Bureau, which are publically available through 2009 TIGER/Line Shapefiles.
     4These climate regions were created by the Building America program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy and Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).
     5Rented includes households that occupy their primary housing unit without payment of rent.
     6Total square footage includes all basements, finished or conditioned (heated or cooled) areas of attics, and conditioned garage space that is attached to the home. Unconditioned and unfinished areas in attics and attached garages are excluded.
     7To determine the number of households below the poverty line, the annual household income and number of household members were compared to the 2009 Poverty Guidelines for families published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
     Q = Data withheld either because the Relative Standard Error (RSE) was greater than 50 percent or fewer than 10 households were sampled.
     N = No cases in reporting sample.
     Notes:  ? Because of rounding, data may not sum to totals.
